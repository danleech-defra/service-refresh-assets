    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="river-levels">How river levels are measured</h2>
    <div>
        <p>We usually measure the height of rivers relative to a fixed point on or close to the riverbed (local datum).</p>
        <p>We also take some measurements relative to average sea level. This is called ‘ordnance datum’ (mAOD).</p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Why a river level can be 0m or below</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Although we take measurements from a fixed point, erosion or silt deposits can cause the riverbed to change height. This does not affect the accuracy of the measurements.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How we forecast river levels</h2>
        <div>
            <p>You might get a flood warning which includes forecasted river levels that are different to that shown on the measuring station page on the service.</p>
            <p>This is because forecasted levels included in flood warnings might be adjusted by an Environment Agency flood forecaster. They are specially trained to interpret flood models and understand technical information about river catchments.</p>
            <p>The models combine real time rainfall and river level observations, along with rainfall and tidal forecasts. The models can be affected by the accuracy of these factors.</p>
            <p>Smaller catchments are more sensitive to small variations in rainfall intensity. This can also affect the accuracy of the modelled forecast.</p>
            <p>The nature of computer modelling also means that sometimes it does not represent the current state of the catchment well enough without being adjusted by a flood forecaster.</p>
            </div>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How they're different to forecasts in flood warnings</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Our river level forecasts come directly from a computer model. Unlike the forecasts in our flood warnings, these are not refined by a flood forecaster.</p>
            <p>If you’re concerned about a river level forecast, you should check for flood warnings.</p>
            <p>The models combine real time rainfall and river level observations, along with rainfall and tidal forecasts. The models can be affected by the accuracy of these factors.</p>
            <p>Smaller catchments are more sensitive to small variations in rainfall intensity. This can also affect the accuracy of the modelled forecast.</p>
            <p>This is why you should always check for flood warnings if you are in doubt about a sudden spike in forecasted river levels on the service.</p>
            </div>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="sea-levels">Sea levels</h2>
    <div>
        <p>We take measurements relative to average sea level. This is called ‘ordnance datum’ (mAOD).</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="groundwater-levels">Groundwater levels</h2>
    <div>
        <p>We measure the height of groundwater in metres relative to average sea level (mAOD).</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="computer-models">How often levels are updated</h2>
    <div>
        <p>On the service, the latest level is updated once or twice a day when there’s a low risk of flooding. It’s updated more frequently when the risk of flooding increases.</p>
    </div>

        <p>How tide levels are measured</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="groundwater">What 'low', 'normal' and 'high' mean</h2>
    <div>
        <p>We calculate the ‘normal’ range using an average of past measurements and other local factors. Low, normal and high are shown when the latest level is below, within or above this range.</p>
